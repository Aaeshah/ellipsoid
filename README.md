# Ellipsoid

Simple implementation of raycasting algorithm for rendering ellipsoids. Ellipsoid can be resized, rotated or moved but its always illuminated from observer position. Algorithm works on CUDA in real-time, but there is option to slow down calculations so one is able to see its adaptive implementation.
